# python ai voice assistant

This is a Python voice assistant that takes two different wake words. One for prompting Bing AI using EdgeGPT and the other will prompt the GPT-3.5-Turbo API"
The wake words for the EdgeGPT are "Hey Bing!" and the wake word for the GPT-3.5-Turbo API is "GPT-3". 

When the user uses either of the wake words, the voice assistant will prompt the respective AI to answer the user's spoken question or statement. This enables the user the access the power of both agents in responding to their queries. By combining the two agents, the user has the ability to get a more sophisticated response that goes beyond what any single agent is capable of.
